## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I gained a better understanding of flexbox. I learnt how to change a classes properties on a listener event so I could hide the ratings card and display the thankyou card upon a click event. I also learnr how to remove focus from a button by using the blur() method which I had not come across before. This is my project using Javascript to add functionality and im very pleased with how it went.
